**AVAMAE Coding Exercise**

My solution to the exercise consists of 3 cs files, all found within the same folder as this document.
-lift.cs: file to manage the lifts features and its operations.
-person.cs file to store the information about each person, including the called and destination floor. 
-main.cs: file in charge of running the algorithm and interacting between the previous two classes.

It takes an input 'input_data.csv' and will output 'output_data.csv'.

The code can be run either through an IDE or by running the ‘AVAMAE_lift’ application in the ‘/bin’ folder.
