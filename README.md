**AVAMAE Coding Exercise**

My solution to the exercise consists of 3 cs files.
- lift.cs: file to manage the lifts features and its operations.
- person.cs file to store the information about each person, including the called and destination floor. 
- main.cs: file in charge of running the algorithm and interacting between the previous two classes.

It takes an input 'input_data.csv' and will output 'output_data.csv'.

The code can be run either running the ‘AVAMAE_lift.exe’ application or entering 'dotnet AVAMAE_lift.dll' in the command line.
